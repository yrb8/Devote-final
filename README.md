## 📌 Abstract
Traditional electronic voting systems face persistent challenges, including vote manipulation, lack of transparency, and centralized control. DeVote addresses these issues by utilizing Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to automate election rules, securely store votes, and ensure immutability without relying on a trusted central authority.

The system integrates a modern web interface with decentralized technologies, enabling voters to participate in elections securely while maintaining transparency and auditability.
